## Git Commit Guidelines

1. **No editor commits**: NEVER use `git commit` without flags; will fail in composer environment.
2. **Single-line format**: Use `git commit -m "concise description"` for all simple commits.
3. **Multi-line commits**: NEVER execute; show exact command for user to run manually.

## Commit message structure

- **First line**: Short description of the change.
- **Blank line**: Separate the first line from the bullet points.
- **Bullet points**: Optional, up to 5 items, each a short phrase or sentence.
- **Whitespace/formatting changes**: Only include if they are the only changes made
